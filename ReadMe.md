# Gallstone Prediction – Data Science Workflow Demonstration

**Predicting gallstone presence using non-invasive clinical, laboratory, and bioimpedance features** with a combination of classical machine learning and deep learning methods.  

This project explores a medical dataset on gallstones with the goal of **demonstrating a complete data science workflow**, rather than establishing a state-of-the-art predictive model.

The focus is on showing how to:

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and identify outliers.

- Apply stratification strategies (by gallstone status, gender) and discuss their effect on model performance.

- Implement cross-validation (CV), nested cross-validation, and compare them to baseline models.

- Use feature selection methods (LASSO) to explore model robustness.

- Evaluate models with multiple metrics (accuracy, F1, ROC AUC) and interpret variability across folds.

- Compare traditional ML (logistic regression with Elastic Net regularization) to a simple neural network (NN) to highlight differences in workflow.

## 💡 Project Workflow

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualize distributions, correlations  
   - Identify patterns between features and target  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values (none in this dataset)  
   - **Stratified train/test split** to preserve class balance  
   - **Stratified K-Fold cross-validation** for robust evaluation  

3. **Modelling with ElasticNet: Baseline and tuning**  
   - Train linear model with L1/L2 regularization  
   - Hyperparameter tuning via cross-validation
   - **Nested cross-validation**
   - Feature Slection with Lasso
   - Evaluate metrics: Accuracy, ROC-AUC

4. **Neural Network Classifier (MLP)**  
   - 2–3 hidden layers with ReLU activation  
   - Dropout and BatchNorm for regularization  
   - Binary cross-entropy loss, Adam optimizer  
   - Compare performance with ElasticNet baseline  
   - SHAP values to identify top predictors
